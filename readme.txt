Algorithm:               To find all the words in the word puzzle, the search(word) function is used.
                         From there, four functions are called, forward_search(word), backwards_search(word),
                         up_search(word), and down_search(word). This is to search all directions to find the
                         words. Each direction has its corresponding for loops to find every word.
